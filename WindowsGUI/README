SimplexAutoExpression uses ANLManaged and watches a windows
file for changes automatically regenerating the output image.
	
	* For example, start SimplexAutoExpression and browse 
	to expression.anl, now any changes to the file will 
	be reflected in the image.

ANLManaged is a managed dll wrapping up the NoiseParser and the VM folder form ANL.
	
SimplexGUI is a simple winforms application linking 
with the Simplex DLL, this was more developmental 
in nature and not recomended.
